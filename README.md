Ubuntu Post Install Scripts
===========================

This project my personal set of post-installation and maintenance scripts for Ubuntu (and Ubuntu-based distributions). It will install favourite applications, set your preferred settings, etc.

Feel free to fork and modify to suit your preferences, and distribute.

##Usage:

Run from main source folder:

    ./ubuntu-post-install-script.sh

Or if you like, you can do as I do and add the scripts' location to your custom shell paths to run on-demand.

	export PATH=${PATH}:$HOME/some/directory/ubuntu-post-install/
