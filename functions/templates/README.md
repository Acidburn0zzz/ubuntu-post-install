## Functions Templates

You can add more functions to install additional third-party apps by easily editing one of the many already included functions, as they are written pretty generically, you need only change the variables. Though there are a few [templates](/functions/templates) readily available for adding functions.

When you do add (or remove) functions be sure to update the main [`thirdparty`](/functions/thirdparty) function to reflect those changes, else the script will fail.
